• This project was an effort in motivating to advance the traditional educational process with the help of a data mining technique. The presented model can act as a guideline for the higher education system to improve its decision-making processes with the help of generated insights.

• This improvement may bring a lot of advantages to the higher education system by maximizing educational system efficiency, increasing student's promotion rate, retention rate, transition rate, education improvement ratio, success, learning outcome, minimizing the cost of system processes, and decreasing student drop-out rate.
